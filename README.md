# Tools and Links
This is a repo that exists as an ongoing reminder of useful things.  I'll be adding to it from time to time.

## QA
### [Big List of Naughty Strings](https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings)
A helpful list of string sequences that might cause issues.  Good for the big QA effort before go-live.

## System
### [Command Line Fu](https://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/browse)
If you are like me you regularly forget more complicated bash commands. This is great help.
